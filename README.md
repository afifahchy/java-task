Explanation of code 1: 
sum of Two numbers 
	1.	The program takes two numbers as input from the user.
	2.	It adds the two numbers and stores the result in sum.
	3.	The sum is then displayed as output

 Explanation of code 2:
Even or Odd
1. The program takes an integer input from the user.
2. It checks if the number is divisible by 2
using the modulus (%) operator:
• If num % 2 == 0, the number is even.
• Otherwise, the number is odd.
3. It prints the appropriate message based on the condition.

   Explanation of code 3: 
Factorial Number 
1. Iterative Approach: Uses a loop to multiply numbers from 1 to n and stores the result in factorial.
2. Recursive Approach: Calls the function repeatedly, reducing n until it reaches 1, multiplying along the way.

   Explanation of Code 4:
Prime or not 
1. The program takes an integer input from the user.
2. The is Prime () method:
• Returns false for numbers ≤1.
• Uses a loop to check divisibility from 2 to v num (optimized method).
• If any divisor is found, it returns false; otherwise, it returns true.
3. The result is displayed accordingly.

   Explanation of Code 5:
Fibonacci numbers
1. The program takes the number of terms as input from the user.
2. It initializes the first two terms of the Fibonacci series (0 and 1).
3. A loop generates and prints the series up to the specified number of terms.
4. The next term is calculated as the sum of the previous two terms.

 Explanation of Code 6: 
Reverse string 
﻿﻿﻿Loop Approach: Iterates through the string from the last character to the first and appends each character to a new string.
﻿﻿﻿StringBuilder Approach: Uses the built-in reverse() method, which is more efficient than string
